# HomeWire-Thesis
Thesis about HomeWire for final semester  
There are already built formats of the document in `output\`, but they may not be up to date.  
If you would like to build the document yourself to see the most recent version of it,
do the following:
- Install [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) with a LaTeX distribution
- Run `pip install pandoc-shortcaption`
- Run `make pdf` or `make html` for your desired output type
- Now you should find the built document under `output\`

I used this template, so I can use Markdown and LaTeX together:
